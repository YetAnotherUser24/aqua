/**
 * Schema-v2 transport for the mixer node. See `aqua_link.h` for the contract and why.
 *
 * The mixer's telemetry is a snapshot of a motor controller rather than a sensor reading, so
 * two of its eight fields are derived rather than measured:
 *
 * - `drv_running` is the control loop's own view, not "duty is non-zero". A commanded 0 % and a
 *   stopped motor are the same reading otherwise, and the difference is what an operator is
 *   looking for.
 * - `drv_stall` comes from the local detector in `esp32s3_main.cpp` (commanded to spin, tacho
 *   under 50 rpm for 500 ms). It is recomputed there and copied through `SharedTelemetry`
 *   rather than re-derived here: two definitions of "stalled" would eventually disagree, and the
 *   one on the wire is the one nobody would be looking at.
